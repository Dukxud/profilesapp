      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <div class="meta-line">Effective Date: November 18, 2025</div>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect
        information when you access or use our websites, applications, software
        (including any VPN client), and related online services (collectively,
        the "Service").
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

      <p><strong>Information you provide to us.</strong></p>
      <p>
        We may collect information that you choose to provide, such as account
        registration details (for example, your name, contact details, and
        billing information), profile information, and any content you upload or
        submit through the Service.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Information collected automatically.</strong></p>
      <p>
        When you use the Service, we may automatically collect certain
        information, which can include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers and technical information about your hardware and software.</li>
        <li>Log data, such as IP address, timestamps, and basic usage information.</li>
        <li>Diagnostic and performance data related to the Service.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Payment information.</strong></p>
      <p>
        If you purchase a subscription or other paid feature, payment
        information is processed by our third-party payment processors. We do
        not store full payment card numbers.
      </p>

      <h2>2. VPN Client and Network Data</h2>
      <p>
        When you use the VPN client or similar security features, some network
        traffic may be routed through our infrastructure or the infrastructure
        of our service providers to apply encryption and related protections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on configuration and your usage, we may process limited
        technical information necessary to establish and maintain secure
        connections, to prevent abuse, and to operate, maintain, and improve the
        Service. We do not seek to associate this technical data with your
        identity beyond what is necessary to provide the Service and comply with
        law.
      </p>

      <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>We may use the information we collect for purposes that include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Providing, operating, and securing the Service.</li>
        <li>Maintaining and improving performance and reliability.</li>
        <li>Processing subscriptions, payments, and account administration.</li>
        <li>Detecting, investigating, and preventing fraud, abuse, or security incidents.</li>
        <li>Complying with legal obligations and enforcing our Terms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. How We Share Information</h2>
      <p>
        We may share information as reasonably necessary for the operation of
        the Service, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          With service providers and vendors that perform services on our behalf
          (for example, hosting, payment processing, analytics, or customer
          support).
        </li>
        <li>
          When required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental
          request.
        </li>
        <li>
          In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a merger,
          acquisition, or asset sale, where your information may be transferred
          as part of the transaction.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal information in the common meaning of that
        term.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain information for as long as reasonably necessary to provide the
        Service, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and
        enforce our agreements. Retention periods may vary based on the type of
        data and the context in which it was collected.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to help
        protect information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or
        disclosure. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely
        secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Your Choices</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding
        your personal information, such as the right to access, correct, or
        delete some of the information we hold about you, or to object to or
        restrict certain processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may provide in-product settings or account tools that allow you to
        update or delete certain information. Where applicable law grants you
        additional rights, you may exercise those rights by following any
        instructions made available within the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>8. International Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        The Service may be provided from servers and infrastructure located in
        different jurisdictions. By using the Service, you understand that your
        information may be transferred to and processed in countries that may
        have data protection laws different from those in your jurisdiction.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do
        not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we
        learn that we have collected such information, we will take reasonable
        steps to delete it.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material
        changes, we may provide notice by updating the "Effective Date" at the
        top of this page, posting an update in the Service, or by other
        reasonable means. Your continued use of the Service after any changes
        become effective constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy
        Policy.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Contact</h2>
      <p>
        If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data
        practices, you may contact us using any in-service contact or support
        feature that we make available within the Service.
