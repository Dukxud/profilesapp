      <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
      <div class="meta-line">Effective Date: November 18, 2025</div>

      <p>
        These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of
        all websites, applications, software (including any VPN client), and
        online services provided by the Company (collectively, the "Service").
      </p>

      <p>
        By creating an account, installing, accessing, or using any part of the
        Service, including any VPN client, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
        If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your
        jurisdiction, to use the Service. By using the Service, you represent
        and warrant that you meet this requirement and that you have the legal
        capacity to enter into a binding agreement.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Accounts and Security</h2>
      <p>
        You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account and
        for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials. You
        agree to notify us promptly of any unauthorized access or use of your
        account.
      </p>

      <h2>3. VPN Client and Data Protection</h2>
      <p>
        The Service may include a VPN client or similar technology designed to
        encrypt certain data before it leaves your device. While we aim to
        improve privacy and security, no security measure is perfect or
        guaranteed.
      </p>
      <p>
        You understand and agree that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Encryption may not apply to all traffic, devices, or applications at
          all times.
        </li>
        <li>
          The VPN client may fail, disconnect, or be misconfigured, and some
          traffic may be transmitted without encryption.
        </li>
        <li>
          You are solely responsible for configuring and using the Service in a
          manner that meets your own security and compliance requirements.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>
        You agree not to misuse the Service. Prohibited conduct includes, but is
        not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using the Service for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any law.</li>
        <li>Infringing the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights.</li>
        <li>
          Attempting to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks, or data,
          or interfering with the normal operation of the Service.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reverse engineering, decompiling, or attempting to derive the source
          code of the Service except where permitted by law.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        The Service, including all associated software, code, interfaces,
        designs, and content (excluding content you submit), is owned by or
        licensed to the Company and is protected by copyright, trademark, and
        other laws. Except for the limited rights expressly granted to you in
        these Terms, no rights are granted, and all rights are reserved.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Subscriptions, Fees, and Taxes</h2>
      <p>
        Access to some or all of the Service may require a paid subscription or
        other fees. Prices, billing terms, and subscription details will be
        presented to you at the point of purchase or in your account settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        By starting a paid subscription, you authorize the Company and its
        payment processors to charge your chosen payment method for all
        applicable fees, taxes, and charges. Unless otherwise stated,
        subscriptions automatically renew at the then-current rate until
        canceled.
      </p>

      <h2>7. No Warranty</h2>
      <p><strong>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available".</strong></p>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company disclaims all
        warranties, whether express, implied, or statutory, including any
        implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
        title, and non-infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of
        dealing or usage of trade.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without limiting the foregoing, the Company does not warrant that the
        Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free, that any defects
        will be corrected, or that the Service will meet your requirements or
        achieve any particular result.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will the Company, its
        affiliates, or their respective officers, directors, employees, or
        agents be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special,
        exemplary, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenue,
        data, or goodwill, arising out of or in connection with your use of or
        inability to use the Service, whether based on contract, tort, strict
        liability, or any other legal theory, even if we have been advised of
        the possibility of such damages.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company's total liability
        for all claims arising out of or relating to the Service or these Terms
        will not exceed the greater of: (a) the amount you paid to the Company
        for access to the Service in the twelve (12) months preceding the event
        giving rise to the claim, or (b) one hundred U.S. dollars (USD $100).
      </p>

      <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company, its
        affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and
        agents from and against any claim, demand, loss, liability, damage,
        cost, or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of
        or related to: (a) your use of the Service, (b) your violation of these
        Terms, or (c) your violation of any applicable law or any rights of a
        third party.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, with
        or without notice, if we believe you have violated these Terms, if we
        discontinue the Service, or for any other reason at our discretion. You
        may stop using the Service at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sections of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination
        (including, without limitation, intellectual property, disclaimers,
        limitations of liability, indemnification, and governing law) will
        survive any termination or expiration.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Changes to the Service or These Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may modify the Service or these Terms at any time. If we make
        material changes, we may provide notice by posting an updated version in
        the Service or by other reasonable means. Your continued use of the
        Service after any changes become effective constitutes your acceptance
        of the revised Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Governing Law and Disputes</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms and your use of the Service are governed by the laws of the
        State of Florida, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Any
        dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms
        or the Service will be brought exclusively in the state or federal
        courts located in Florida, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction
        of such courts.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Miscellaneous</h2>
      <p>
        If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable,
        that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and
        the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        No waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective unless in
        writing and signed by the Company. Failure to enforce any right or
        provision will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.
